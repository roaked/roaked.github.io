Actuation System: This handles the rotors&amp;rsquo; model, the forces they generate ( \(F_p\) ), and the moments they create ( \(M_p\) ).</description></item><item><title>Drone Controller Design Pt. 1</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index3/</guid><description>Controller Design Pt. 1 # tip
If you wish to skip the theoretical and implementation details, please click here to jump to the summarized findings Ch. 9 - Piloting in a Loop. I have cool images! ✌️ 1 Continuing from Section 1&amp;hellip; # Previously, I had addressed problem formulation and initial approaches. The primary tasks included studying the system and subsystems, creating a state-space model for the dynamical system, analyzing aspects like linearity, stability, controllability, and observability, developing Simulink models, proposing classical state feedback control, and validating the simulator for the developed models.</description></item><item><title>Drone Controller Design Pt. 2</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index4/</guid><description> Controller Design Pt.2 # 1 #</description></item><item><title>Drone Computer Vision</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index5/</guid><description>Pixel Pilots: Drone Computer Vision # 1 Computer Vision for Obstacle Detection # In preparation for the Red Bull drone race, a comprehensive dataset was compiled, consisting of images capturing gates from diverse angles, distances, and lighting conditions. These images showcase the gates amidst various backgrounds, providing a range of scenarios that drones might encounter during the race. The intention behind gathering such a varied dataset is to enable the development of an algorithm capable of accurately identifying these gates despite changes in perspective, distance, lighting, and background colors, facilitating precise navigation for the drones during the high-paced race.</description></item></channel></rss>
