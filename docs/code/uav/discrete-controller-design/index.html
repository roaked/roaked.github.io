A zero-order hold was implemented at the input of the continuous system, and a sample time of 0.01s was assumed. Computing the poles of the obtained discrete models can be obtained:</p><span>\[\left|zI - \bar{A}\right| = 0\]</span><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53355765118_b7b9974302_b.jpg alt=1></p><p>This figure displays the root locus concerning the second and fourth-order discrete systems. As anticipated, all poles are positioned at z = 1, aligning with the system&rsquo;s marginal stability where its poles were situated at s = 0 in continuous time.</p><p>In earlier project sections, the system underwent analysis regarding its controllability and observability. With the current focus on a discrete model, the evaluation extends to its reachability — confirming the system&rsquo;s capability to transition from any initial state to any final state through a finite actuation sequence. Additionally, observability is scrutinized to determine if it&rsquo;s feasible to ascertain the initial state from observing the system output within a specified time interval.</p><p>Two other pertinent properties are controlability, assured if reachability is established, and reconstructability, ensured if observability is confirmed. These aspects collectively contribute to understanding and manipulating the system in its discrete form.

<a class=anchor href=#3-controller-design>#</a></h2><p>With the verification of reachability and observability properties, the stage is set for designing the necessary controllers and observers. Notably, based on preceding project findings, I opted against designing a controller via pole placement. I will explore two strategies: the discrete linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and the model predictive control (MPC), both extensively discussed and analyzed in subsequent sections.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 info"><p class="hint-title info"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#info-notice"/></svg><span>info</span></p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that these two controllers employ slightly different design approaches. The <code>LQR</code> is specifically tailored for each of the subsystems outlined in the previous section, mirroring the approach taken with the continuous system. This direct strategy aligns with the existence of four independent subsystems and their corresponding references, essential for the drone&rsquo;s tracking, considering that the roll and pitch variables are not directly controlled.</p><p>In contrast, the <code>MPC</code> considers the entire 12th order discretized system. The group&rsquo;s design parameters necessitated the inclusion of roll and pitch variables in the system output for better drone stabilization. While this could have been achieved by modifying the previously presented subsystems, the <a href=https://www.mathworks.com/products/model-predictive-control.html>MPC MATLAB toolbox&rsquo;s</a> graphical interface offered a more intuitive and convenient method to design the MPC for the entire system.</p></blockquote><h3 id=31-linear-quadratic-regulator>3.1. Linear Quadratic Regulator
<a class=anchor href=#31-linear-quadratic-regulator>#</a></h3><p><a href=https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/uav/continuous-controller-design/#5-linear-quadratic-regulator>In the preceding phase</a>, I presented and executed the LQR in the continuous domain. Now, in this phase of the project, the discrete iteration of the LQR was implemented. The LQR inherently seeks an optimal controller capable of striking a balance between performance and minimizing actuation. It achieves this by aiming to minimize the discrete version of the performance index.</p><span>\[J = \int_{0}^{\infty} (x^T(t)Qx(t) + u^T(t)Ru(t)) \, dt\]</span><p>Similar to the <a href=https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/uav/continuous-controller-design/#5-linear-quadratic-regulator>approach in the continuous domain</a>, matrix Q penalizes state deviations from zero, while matrix R penalizes significant actuations. However, previously, the LQR values were primarily optimized for step responses, whereas, in this phase, the optimization targeted trajectory following, commencing with the straightforward square trajectory. Employing a trial-and-error method, the following values were selectedfor each subsystem:</p><span>\[Q_{\text{vertical}} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 100 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0.01 \\
\end{bmatrix} \quad R_{\text{vertical}} \]

\end{bmatrix} \quad R_{\text{lateral}}\]</span><h3 id=32-model-predictive-control>3.2. Model Predictive Control
<a class=anchor href=#32-model-predictive-control>#</a></h3><p>The model predictive control (MPC) operates similarly to the LQR, employing an optimization approach for controller derivation. However, MPC integrates constraints within the optimization problem, addressing limitations concerning both actuation and state variables, including their respective rates of change.</p><p>In addition to imposed variable restrictions, MPC involves tuning two key parameters: the prediction horizon (<code>Hp</code>), dictating how far into the future the output is forecasted, and the control horizon (<code>Hc</code>), determining the prediction span for control actions. When both horizons tend to infinity, MPC&rsquo;s behavior aligns with what would be achieved using an LQR.</p><p>Concerning Hp tuning, a larger time interval generally enhances performance, but this can compromise MPC&rsquo;s efficacy, particularly with smaller sample times. With a 0.01s sample time, performance issues were found. To align <code>Hp</code> closer to the system&rsquo;s settling time, the computation time needed significantly exceeded the physical time available, rendering it impractical for real-time application. Hence, it was opted to reduce the MPC&rsquo;s sample time to 0.1s, enabling real-time execution while maintaining good control performance.</p><p><code>Hp</code> tuning significantly impacts MPC stability; it should be smaller than <code>Hc</code> for stability. Beyond this requirement, its value is determined through a trial-and-error process for optimal control results.</p><p>Concerning actuation restrictions, the MPC considered physical limitations in the motors, as represented:</p><span>\[0 &lt; u &lt; 11.1 \text{(V)}\]</span><blockquote class="book-hint2 warning"><p class="hint-title warning"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#warning-notice"/></svg><span>warning</span></p><p>Throughout this project, a prominent factor contributing to the unstable behavior of the nonlinear model was the significant tilt angle (pitch and roll) exhibited by the drone. Consequently, these restrictions were enforced within the MPC.</p><p><code>−0.2 &lt; pitch &lt; 0.2</code> ✔️
<code>−0.2 &lt; roll &lt; 0.2</code> ✔️</p></blockquote><p>The weight allocated to each reference tracking error underwent a trial-and-error tuning process. It&rsquo;s crucial to note that the highest weight was assigned to the vertical reference to prevent substantial altitude loss in the nonlinear model during lateral movements. This strategic allocation aimed to maintain stability and minimize altitude fluctuations during such maneuvers.</p><h2 id=4-kalman-filter-design>4 Kalman Filter Design
<a class=anchor href=#4-kalman-filter-design>#</a></h2><p>In the ongoing phases of this project, it&rsquo;s acknowledged that real-world measurements are inevitably corrupted by noise. Specifically for the drone, six independent measurements are assumed to be affected by white noise with known variances. As these noisy measurements can impact the drone&rsquo;s performance, selecting an estimator to mitigate these effects becomes imperative. Consequently, I employed the Kalman filter for this purpose.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 info"><p class="hint-title info"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#info-notice"/></svg><span>info</span></p>Notably, in this phase of the project, where the primary focus lies in achieving optimal results within more realistic scenarios, the discrete Luenberger observer was disregarded.</blockquote><details><summary>Noise variances for Kalman Filter - (click to expand)</summary><div class=markdown-inner><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Noise Variance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Px</td><td>7.3221e-4</td></tr><tr><td>Py</td><td>4.2829e-4</td></tr><tr><td>Pz</td><td>1.8000e-4</td></tr><tr><td>Roll</td><td>3.4817e-4</td></tr><tr><td>Pitch</td><td>2.6060e-4</td></tr><tr><td>Yaw</td><td>3.8313e-5</td></tr></tbody></table></div></details><p>The matrix <span>\(Q_0\)

<a class=anchor href=#5-simulation>#</a></h2><p>To evaluate the designed controllers, three distinct trajectories were selected: <strong>the simple square</strong>, <strong>the crazy 8</strong>, and <strong>the amazing race</strong> trajectories. While the waypoints forming these trajectories were provided, details such as the time instances for the drone to traverse each waypoint and the specific path geometry connecting these waypoints were left as design parameters to determine.</p><p>It is hoped to outline the methodology adopted to derive the ultimate trajectories implemented in the simulator. It is also shown the attained results and remarks on the drone&rsquo;s behaviour throughout these trajectories, shedding light on its performance under different control schemes.</p><h3 id=51-implementation>5.1. Implementation
<a class=anchor href=#51-implementation>#</a></h3><p>Two Simulink files — one for the LQR and another for the MPC — were created. The LQR implementation utilized relevant blocks, while the MPC and Kalman filter were integrated using available Simulink blocks.</p><p>Efforts were made to ensure the simulator closely mimicked a real system. Consequently, both the linear and nonlinear models are continuous, while the LQR, MPC, and Kalman filter operate in discrete time. However, in practice, signals processed by discrete elements in a computer would consist of sampled points rather than the &ldquo;stair-like&rdquo; signals simulated using the zero-order hold.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 warning"><p class="hint-title warning"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#warning-notice"/></svg><span>warning</span></p>Despite attempts to replicate this behaviour using a sampler block, the Simulink solver continued to produce &ldquo;stair-like&rdquo; signals. Nonetheless, this discrepancy does not invalidate the results obtained, as the discrete blocks only consider signals at each multiple of the sample time. This effect is likely related to limitations within the solver.</blockquote><p>Another crucial consideration is that the linearized model assumes a zero yaw angle. As the controllers were developed based on this assumption, the nonlinear model encounters issues when the yaw is not zero. To address this, a rotation about the z-axis must be applied to the output of the nonlinear model, as depicted in equation 24. This adjustment allows for the use of the same linear controllers, yielding satisfactory results even when the yaw is not zero in the nonlinear model.</p><span>\[\dot{p} = \begin{bmatrix}

<a class=anchor href=#52-trajectories>#</a></h3><p>The connection between provided waypoints requires a specified time function. At the minimum, this function must satisfy the values at both the beginning and end of the designated time interval, a requirement easily met by a rectilinear line.</p><p>However, to ensure a smoother trajectory that the drone can follow with minimal error, additional conditions must be addressed. These conditions encompass specifying the velocity and acceleration at the initial and final time instants. This necessitates the use of third and fifth-order polynomials, respectively. A firth-order polynomial was chosen offering enhanced flexibility in shaping trajectories and ensuring smoother transitions between waypoints, critical for the drone&rsquo;s trajectory tracking.</p><span>\[x(t) = a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\]</span><p>Each trajectory segment for every reference (including three coordinates and yaw) is described by a fifth-order polynomial. To achieve zero velocities and accelerations at the initial and final time instants, denoted as <span>\(t_i\)
</span>and <span>\(t_f\)
</span>, the following equation can be utilized:</p><p>\dot{x}(t_i) = \dot{x}(t_f) = \ddot{x}(t_i) = \ddot{x}(t_f) = 0</p><p>For waypoints situated along a rectilinear section of the trajectory, constant velocities to enhance lap time were chosen. Consequently, in such cases, the fifth-order polynomial simplifies into a rectilinear line, offering a straightforward and efficient path between these waypoints.</p><details><summary>Reference tracking for x,y,z and yaw for the Linear model with noise - (click to expand)</summary><div class=markdown-inner><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354670987_8a70ccb2c9.jpg alt=2></div></details><blockquote class="book-hint2 example"><p class="hint-title example"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#example-notice"/></svg><span>example</span></p>For better understanding, the trajectories were exemplified.

Consequently, the MPC might hold untapped potential not fully explored in this project, presenting an area for further improvement and exploration.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 tip"><p class="hint-title tip"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#tip-notice"/></svg><span>tip</span></p><a href=https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/uav/computer-vision/>Advance to UAV Computer Vision Here ✌️</a></blockquote></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/roaked/roaked.github.io/commit/60543850993bcff873b1abf7b7a0fc9075de9ca2 title='Last modified by roaked | January 17, 2024' target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
