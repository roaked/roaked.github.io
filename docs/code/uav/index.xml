Actuation System: This handles the rotors&amp;rsquo; model, the forces they generate ( \(F_p\) ), and the moments they create ( \(M_p\) ).</description></item><item><title>Continuous Controller</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/continuous-controller-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/continuous-controller-design/</guid><description>Phase 2.

If you wish to skip the theoretical and implementation details, please click here to jump to the summarized findings Ch. 9 - Piloting in a Loop. I have cool images! ✌️ 1 Continuing from Phase 1&amp;hellip; # Previously, I had addressed problem formulation and initial approaches. The primary tasks included studying the system and subsystems, creating a state-space model for the dynamical system, analyzing aspects like linearity, stability, controllability, and observability, developing Simulink models, proposing classical state feedback control, and validating the simulator for the developed models.</description></item><item><title>Discrete Controller</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/discrete-controller-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/discrete-controller-design/</guid><description>Phase 3.

I have cool images! ✌️ 1 Continuing from Phase 2&amp;hellip; # In this phase 3, a more practical approach was adopted to tackle the problem. Discrete controllers and observers were designed for the drone, with simulations implemented to test it in a highly realistic environment.</description></item><item><title>Gate Sense: Computer Vision</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/computer-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/computer-vision/</guid><description>Phase 4.
