<a class=anchor href=#1-continuing-from-phase-1>#</a></h2><p>Previously, I had addressed problem formulation and initial approaches. The primary tasks included studying the system and subsystems, creating a state-space model for the dynamical system, analyzing aspects like linearity, stability, controllability, and observability, developing Simulink models, proposing classical state feedback control, and validating the simulator for the developed models.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 info"><p class="hint-title info"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#info-notice"/></svg><span>info</span></p>Following the delivery of Phase I, issues were identified in the drone controller. Although functional, some minor problems remained unresolved. The movement subsystem had initially been modeled as a 12th order system, established as linearizable, controllable, and observable. In the upcoming work, the decision was made to break down the movement system into four subsystems: vertical, lateral, longitudinal axis movement, and yaw subsystem.</blockquote><p>The primary objective is to formulate and address optimal control and estimation problems. It is intended to compare outcomes from the pole placement controller and the Luenberger observer with those achieved using the optimal controller (Linear Quadratic Regulator) and optimal observer (Kalman-Bucy observer).</p><h2 id=2-actuation-and-sensors>2 Actuation and Sensors
<a class=anchor href=#2-actuation-and-sensors>#</a></h2><p>Before commencing the formulation and implementation of the required controllers and estimators, there are preliminary details that necessitate consideration.</p><p>One of the initial considerations revolves around the actuation, specifically the voltages applied to each motor. It was established during the project&rsquo;s initial phase that the model was linearized under a hovering condition. From this state, the computation of the required equilibrium motor actuation was derived.</p><link rel=stylesheet href=/katex/katex.min.css><script defer src=/katex/katex.min.js></script><script defer src=/katex/auto-render.min.js onload=renderMathInElement(document.body)></script><span>\[V_0 = 7.9V\]</span><p>In the context of the linear model, a null actuation maintains the system in a hovering state, implying no resultant motion. This characteristic arises from the actuation being a deviation from the nominal value rather than the actual voltage applied to the motors. To prevent motor saturation, it&rsquo;s crucial to adhere to the following voltage deviation constraints:</p><p><span>\[\Delta V_{\text{max}} = V_{\text{bat}} - V_0 = 11.1 - 7.9 = 3.2 \, \text{V}\]
</span><span>\[\Delta V_{\text{min}} = V_0 = 7.9 \, \text{V}\]</span></p><p>In the non-linear model, maintaining the hovering condition necessitates applying V0 to all motors. However, the controllers are formulated based on the linear model. Therefore, the voltage offset should only be added after the controllers compute the necessary actuation. As a result, the maximum and minimum voltage deviations align with those of the linear model. Another crucial aspect involves the design of observers. Understanding which state variables lack direct physical measurement is essential, as these variables demand estimation using an observer.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354560156_b9fd30fa8b_z.jpg alt=147></p><p>For the drone in question, only the position (Px, Py, and Pz) and orientation (<span>

<a class=anchor href=#4-luanberger-observer>#</a></h2><p>As previously mentioned, the onboard sensors can only physically measure position and orientation. Consequently, the estimation of linear and angular velocities within the subsystems&rsquo; state vectors becomes necessary.</p><p>The fundamental concept behind an estimator involves creating a numerical simulator of the physical system, receiving actuation as input, and producing the state space vector estimation as output. However, this approach alone isn&rsquo;t sufficient. The estimation error can asymptotically vanish if the state is unstable, and the convergence velocity of the error is limited by the system&rsquo;s velocity.</p><p>To address this, the implementation of a Luenberger observer is essential. As depicted in the following figure, the adjustment of observer performance can be achieved by tuning the parameters within matrix L.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53355010430_806fed4271_z.jpg alt=124918></p><p>To derive the Luenberger observer, it&rsquo;s crucial to select the desired poles ensuring that the observer operates faster than the system dynamics without excessively amplifying modeling errors. In this scenario, for this system, a choice was made to position the poles 10 times faster than those of the controller, thus setting all poles at -50. Additionally, it&rsquo;s pertinent to note that, as previously explained in the initial phase, the system is observable.</p><p>Utilizing Ackermann’s formula, specifically via the <a href=https://de.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/place.html>MATLAB function &ldquo;acker&rdquo;</a>, the matrix L for the designed Luenberger observer for the vertical, yaw, lateral, and longitudinal subsystems can be described in the following equations:</p><span>\[L_{\text{vertical}} = \begin{bmatrix} 2500 \\ 100 \end{bmatrix}\]
</span><span>\[L_{\text{yaw}} = \begin{bmatrix} 2500 \\ 100 \end{bmatrix}\]
</span><span>\[L_{\text{lateral}} = \begin{bmatrix} 6.371 \\ 0.510 \\ 0.150 \\ 0.002 \end{bmatrix}\]
</span><span>\[L_{\text{longitudinal}} = \begin{bmatrix} -6.371 \\ -0.510 \\ 0.150 \\ 0.002 \end{bmatrix}\]</span><h2 id=5-linear-quadratic-regulator>5 Linear Quadratic Regulator
<a class=anchor href=#5-linear-quadratic-regulator>#</a></h2><p>The pole placement method demonstrated in the previous sections yielded satisfactory outcomes. However, it poses challenges in tuning the controller, becoming increasingly complex as the system&rsquo;s order increases. Additionally, it complicates the task of finding a compromise between conflicting objectives when designing a controller.</p><p>In light of this, the focus now shifts to considering an optimal controller that takes into account conflicting goals and strategically places poles in an optimal manner. Specifically, the design will involve a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). In designing an optimal controller, the usual objective is to minimize energy consumption (represented by the control action) while maximizing the distance traveled—objectives that clearly conflict.</p><p>The initial step involves selecting a performance index J that reflects these conflicting objectives. In this case, the performance index specified by the following equation is utilized, aiming to be minimized.</p><span>\[J = \int_{0}^{\infty} (x^T(t) Q x(t) + u^T(t) R u(t)) \, dt\]</span><p>Certainly, in a manner akin to PID controller parameters, the matrices Q (where Q ≥ 0) and R (where R > 0) play a pivotal role. They contribute to the behaviour of the system and need to be tuned to achieve the desired system response. Augmenting Q results in faster convergence of states toward the reference, while increasing R penalizes larger control inputs. The balance between performance and energy expended is thus represented by the relative values assigned to both matrices.</p><p>In an optimal controller, the controller gains aren&rsquo;t constant over time. However, it&rsquo;s more common to design a sub-optimal controller where K is a constant value. Adhering to this approach, the computation of matrix K is outlined:</p><span>\[K = R^{-1}B^T P\]</span><blockquote class="book-hint2 tip"><p class="hint-title tip"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#tip-notice"/></svg><span>tip</span></p>Matrix P is the solution of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_Riccati_equation>algebraic Riccati equation</a>.</blockquote><p>It was mentioned that, in pursuit of tracking a reference rather than merely maintaining states at zero, <a href=https://de.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/ss.lqi.html>the MATLAB function &ldquo;lqi&rdquo; (linear quadratic integrator)</a> becomes crucial as it computes both K and ki values.</p><p>The success in achieving desired performance largely hinges on the choice of relative values within Q and R matrices. Specifically, emphasis was placed on the need to tune diagonal values, allowing for certain values to be set to zero if controlling a particular state isn&rsquo;t deemed necessary.</p><p>Regarding the yaw angle and vertical axis subsystems, considering their augmented third-order nature, the prescribed values for Q and R were specified through equations:</p><span>\[Q_{\text{yaw}} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 10 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 50 \\
\end{bmatrix}

1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 50 & 0 \\

<a class=anchor href=#6-kalman-bucy-observer>#</a></h2><p>It was highlighted earlier that the system&rsquo;s onboard sensors aren&rsquo;t ideal and will inevitably introduce noise into the measurements. This noise can significantly impact the system&rsquo;s performance, potentially leading to errors when following a reference and even instability in the drone&rsquo;s motion, particularly in the more sensitive nonlinear system, susceptible to actuation oscillations.</p><p>There are two distinct noise types—process noise (v(t)) and sensor noise (w(t)), both assumed to be zero-mean white noise with known variance.</p><p>Due to the presence of noise in the measured values, the accuracy of the implemented Luenberger observer in estimating the state space variables diminishes. To counteract this, the Kalman-Bucy observer will be utilized.</p><p>The process of tuning the Kalman filter gains in matrix Lk involves adjusting Q0 and R0 values. The known variance values from the sensor noise were allocated to R0.</p><p>Q0 values were determined via a trial-and-error approach until the noise impact was minimized. The resulting values for the yaw, vertical, longitudinal, and lateral subsystems are articulated in equations:</p><p><span>\[Q_0^\text{yaw} = 10^{-6}\]
</span><span>\[Q_0^\text{vertical} = 10^{-6}\]
</span><span>\[Q_0^\text{longitudinal} = 10^{-10}\]
</span><span>\[Q_0^\text{lateral} = 10^{-10}\]</span></p><p>Combining the developed LQR with the Kalman-Bucy observer results the Linear Quadratic Gaussian.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53354783288_ddc4e8a856_c.jpg alt=124f></p><p>It&rsquo;s crucial to note that, similar to the LQR, the relative values assigned to Q0 and R0 significantly impact the observer&rsquo;s performance. Consequently, the small values in Q0 correspond to the small values of sensor noise variances present in R0.</p><p>Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that despite my best effort, successfully eliminating the noise proved challenging. This difficulty persisted even after attempting various values for the Kalman filter parameters. The impact of these results, particularly evident in the nonlinear simulation, is thoroughly discussed in the simulation results.</p><h2 id=7-simulation-results>7 Simulation Results
<a class=anchor href=#7-simulation-results>#</a></h2><p>I conducted comprehensive testing of the implemented controllers (via pole placement and LQR) and observers (Luenberger and Kalman-Bucy) using both the linear simulator developed in the initial phase and the full nonlinear simulator provided in the subsequent phase.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 warning"><p class="hint-title warning"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#warning-notice"/></svg><span>warning</span></p><p>Two primary tests were conducted to evaluate performance:</p><ul><li><ol><li>Step Reference Test: This involved applying step changes to the four references (Px, Py, Pz, and ψ).

The aim was to comprehensively evaluate the controllers&rsquo; and observers&rsquo; performance under various scenarios and noise conditions using different trajectory types.

<a class=anchor href=#73-remarks>#</a></h3><p>From the comprehensive results obtained from both linear and nonlinear models, it can be concluded that all controllers and observers were correctly implemented and exhibited their intended functionality.</p><p>An essential finding across both models was the significance of using the Kalman-Bucy observer when noise significantly impacts sensor readings. This observer proved crucial in handling noisy measurements effectively.</p><p>Careful consideration of roll and pitch angles was emphasized due to their potential impact on causing rapid altitude loss in the nonlinear simulation. Numerous instability issues were encountered, especially when step values were too large, resulting in aggressive actuation and subsequent system instability. To mitigate these issues, alternative reference signals were introduced to reduce initial error and consequent motor actuation.</p><blockquote class="book-hint2 note"><p class="hint-title note"><svg class="book-icon"><use href="/svg/hint-icons.svg#note-notice"/></svg><span>note</span></p>Addressing actuation saturation and avoiding extreme pitch and roll angles can be achieved through various methods. One such solution involves implementing a saturation block on motors to ensure voltages stay within permissible limits. However, a straightforward saturation approach on individual motors may hinder the drone from following the desired trajectory. To resolve this, a strategy of limiting all actuations whenever one motor saturates allows the drone to continually attempt trajectory following without losing control or erratic behavior. This approach ensures a more controlled response in scenarios where actuation saturation or extreme angles could destabilize the system.</blockquote><h2 id=8-trajectory-following>8 Trajectory Following
<a class=anchor href=#8-trajectory-following>#</a></h2><p>After successfully testing the system with step references, I implemented a trajectory using a series of ramps to guide the drone&rsquo;s trajectory, aiming to minimize initial error. This trajectory, designed to trace a &ldquo;8&rdquo; shape with the drone landing at its initial take-off position, underwent testing in both the linear and nonlinear models.</p><p>To determine the maximum slope of the reference ramps, a trial-and-error process was conducted using the nonlinear model. By gradually increasing the slopes of the ramps (for the four references) until the drone became uncontrollable. Moreover, it was noted that the maximum pitch and roll angles remained below 0.6 radians (approximately 35 degrees).</p><p>Similar to the steps test, I was interested in evaluating trajectory tracking accuracy, assessing steep roll and pitch angles, and identifying any actuation saturation during the ramp trajectory test. Considering previous conclusions, I opted to use the Linear Quadratic Regulator without noise and the Linear Quadratic Gaussian when noise was introduced to the sensors. This choice allows for a comprehensive evaluation of trajectory tracking performance and system stability under different conditions, ensuring the suitability of the controllers and observers for both noise-free and noisy sensor scenarios.</p><h3 id=81-linear-model>8.1.
