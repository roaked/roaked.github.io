Operating across numerous generations, it simulates the evolutionary process observed in natural populations, adhering to the principles of natural selection and the concept of &amp;ldquo;survival of the fittest.&amp;rdquo; By emulating this phenomenon, GAs possess the capability to &amp;ldquo;evolve&amp;rdquo; solutions for real-world problems, provided they have been encoded effectively.</description></item><item><title>Particle Swarm Optimization</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/bin-packing/particle-swarm-optimization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/bin-packing/particle-swarm-optimization/</guid><description>Disco Dance of Particles # 1 Algorithm Concept # Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) draws its inspiration from the social dynamics seen in various species, like birds and insects, as they navigate their environments to fulfill their needs. In this method, each potential solution is likened to a particle, and these particles come together to form a dynamic swarm. Each particle possesses two key characteristics: its position and its velocity. Utilizing this velocity, each particle embarks on a journey to a new position within the search space.</description></item></channel></rss>
