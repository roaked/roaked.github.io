Approach
<a class=anchor href=#16-approach>#</a></h3><p>A study was conducted on various existing construction solutions available in the market for this type of equipment. For the girders, a box-type section was chosen with a constant thickness of 10mm, made of AISI 1095 steel, and measuring 10m in length. These girders consist of 4 steel plates welded together with a 5mm thick welding bead. The rails are positioned on the girders, not aligned with the vertical plane passing through the girder&rsquo;s centroid, as this alignment would create a high bending moment on the upper plate of the girder. The connection between the girders and the trolley frame is established using 6 bolts M36x4 CR 10.9 and welding with a 10mm thick bead.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53349230049_69f514c133_w.jpg alt=saassa></p><p>The chosen hoist trolley is the <a href=https://www.manualslib.com/products/Stahl-Sh-5020-25-11019601.html>STAHL - SH 5020</a>, which has a wheelbase of 1m and a mass of 755 kg.

The labour cost is around €9/m, and the analyzed structure totals 53.2m, amounting to approximately €478.8.</p><h3 id=19-general-simplifications>1.9. General Simplifications
<a class=anchor href=#19-general-simplifications>#</a></h3><p>Only the main components were designed, namely the girders. The trolley frames and the remaining support structure were not designed. The studied overhead crane was interior, simplifying the analysis, as exterior conditions would introduce wind forces. For the sizing, it was considered that the hoist trolley was positioned in the middle of the girders (longitudinally), as this situation causes the greatest deformations.</p><h2 id=2-calculations>2 Calculations
<a class=anchor href=#2-calculations>#</a></h2><h3 id=21-material>2.1. Material
<a class=anchor href=#21-material>#</a></h3><p>Due to the high stresses to which the box girder of the overhead crane is subjected, it&rsquo;s necessary to select a structural steel with considerable yield strength to ensure the component meets service conditions and to minimize stress concentration and fatigue issues. With this in mind, the following steel with a tempering and tempering treatment was chosen:</p><table><thead><tr><th>S_u</th><th>S_y</th><th>E</th><th>G</th><th>\nu</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1210 MPa</td><td>772 MPa</td><td>210 GPa</td><td>81 GPa</td><td>0.3</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=22-dimensioning-criteria>2.2.

Beam Sizing
<a class=anchor href=#23-beam-sizing>#</a></h3><h4 id=231-static-verification>2.3.1. Static Verification
<a class=anchor href=#231-static-verification>#</a></h4><p>To size the beam, an analytical model was developed considering two vertical loads corresponding to the nominal load and the weight of the trolley. The value of each of these two forces was previously defined according to the <a href=https://www.fem-eur.com/>FEM standards</a>, already multiplied by the dynamic coefficient and the amplification coefficient. The value of each force is 26.7 kN and they are spaced 1 meter apart. Additionally, the weight of the beam itself, which is not negligible, is represented as a distributed load. To verify the stiffness criterion, an H/L ratio of 2.2 was initially chosen.
Using tables of maximum deflection, employing the superposition method and also considering the load P equivalent to 26700N and the load application point (offset) at x = 4.5 m, the following expression for the beam&rsquo;s maximum deflection is obtained:</p><span>\[
y_{\text{max}} = 2 \left[ \left( \frac{P \times b}{6 \times E \times I_z \times 10} \right) \times \left( \left( 5^3 - \left( 10^2 - b^2 \right) \times 5 \right) \right) - \frac{5 \times w \times 10^4}{384 \times E \times I} \right]
\]</span><p>Next, an expression for a given moment of inertia around z, Iz, was obtained as a function of the section&rsquo;s height H.</p><span>\[
I_z = \frac{2}{10^{12}} \left[\left(10 \times (2H - 20)^3\right) + \left({2L \times 10^3}\right)\right] + 10L(H - 5)^2
\]</span><p>The distributed loading, w, was defined using the density of the chosen material (<span>

</span>) = 78450 N/<span>
\(m^3\)
</span>:</p><span>\[
w = \frac{Volume \times \rho}{L} = 4.564H - 31.38
\]</span><p>Upon solving the equation for maximum deflection, an expression in terms of H was obtained. From the graph, a value of H = 260 mm was selected, corresponding to L = 118.2 mm, thereby fulfilling the rigidity criterion.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53348060477_57f703bfeb_w.jpg alt=saass12121a></p><p>At present, the computation of the Von Mises equivalent stress has become feasible.

<a class=anchor href=#232-fatigue-verification>#</a></h4><p>The minimum stress is determined by the weight of the beam and the winch car itself (considering the winch car unloaded). Conversely, when the winch car is loaded (the scenario considered for calculating the static safety factor), the corresponding stress will be at its maximum. It can be derived the ratio between the minimum and maximum stresses by calculating the minimum stress for the unloaded car. Repeating this process for the calculation of the Von Mises stress for the unloaded load case yields.</p><span>\[

<a class=anchor href=#241-beam-analysis>#</a></h4><p>For the analysis of the resilient beam using finite element methods, the commercial software Solidworks was employed. The numerical model comprises a simply supported beam on the two hinges of the plate to be bolted to the winch&rsquo;s head, with a load of 27.6 kN applied at the geometric location where the winch car wheels would be. The beam&rsquo;s self-weight is also considered.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53348105597_f2355695a3.jpg alt=saa234ss12121a></p><p>In terms of the developed stresses, at the neutral axis (which in this case is the centroidal axis), the Von Mises equivalent stress is zero or close to zero, as expected. It is also inferred that the highest stresses exist at the outermost fibers of the section, where there is a maximum tensile stress in the lower outer fiber and a compressive stress in the upper outer fiber.</p><p>Both these stresses are considerably lower than the material&rsquo;s yield stress, ensuring the specified safety factor.</p><p><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53348105582_74015a2bab.jpg alt=saa234ss112323112121a></p><p>The maximum deflection due to loading measures 9.584 mm and is positioned at the midpoint of the beam span. Comparing this with the analytically obtained deflection of 11.5 mm, there is a relative error of 16.7%. This error arises from the consideration of internal reinforcements within the beam and, simultaneously, from the boundary conditions not being applied at the beam ends but rather at the hinge point.</p><h4 id=242-assembly-analysis>2.4.2. Assembly Analysis

</span>.</p><p>The procedure for calculating the weld beads in the three cases is similar, involving the computation of the unit second moment of area (Ju), the moment of inertia (Is) and the weld area (As). For the calculation of the unit second moment of area for more complex sections, it is feasible to compute it by dividing the section into several rectangles and selecting the appropriate expression from the table (Table 9-1 and 9-2 in <a href="https://books.google.at/books/about/Shigley_s_Mechanical_Engineering_Design.html?id=B7wivgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Shigley&rsquo;s book</a>) corresponding to the specific case.</p><span>\[

J = J_u \times a = 5.501 \times 10^{-4} \text{m}^4
\]</span><p>As outlined in Table 9.1 <a href="https://books.google.at/books/about/Shigley_s_Mechanical_Engineering_Design.html?id=B7wivgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">in Shigley&rsquo;s book</a>, the formula for the throat area is expressed as follows:</p><span>\[
A_s = 0.707 \times h \times d = 0.707 \times 20 \times 0.005 = 0.0707 \text{m}^2
\]</span><p>With this data, it is possible to calculate the primary shear stress:</p><span>\[

They also serve as a means to provide additional stiffness to the box beam. The shear stresses present in the two webs of the box beam, during loading and translation of the beam, could lead to detrimental localized deformations affecting the equipment. It was recommended that vertical transverse reinforcements should also be applied to areas where the beam is supported and bolted to the &ldquo;headstock&rdquo;.</p><p>According to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_Manufacturers_Association_of_America>CMAA (Crane Manufacturers Association of America)</a> specification for overhead cranes, the spacing between vertical reinforcements should not exceed:</p><span>\[

Therefore, the throat height, a, is such that ar = <span>\(\frac{h}{sqrt{2}}\)

\tau_{\text{V}} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{31350}{0.00354 \times (2 \times 0.5)} = 8.867 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa}
\]</span><p>The calculation of the angle between the stresses caused by the torsional moment and the transverse force involved using the following expression:</p><span>\[
\cos \theta = \frac{0.25}{r} = 0.954 \Rightarrow \theta = \cos^{-1}(0.954) = 0.303 \, \text{rad} = 17.378^\circ
