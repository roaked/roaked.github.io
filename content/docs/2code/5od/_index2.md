## 1 Theoretical Remarks

Genetic Algorithm (GA) stands as an adaptive method employed for resolving search and optimization dilemmas. Operating across numerous generations, it simulates the evolutionary process observed in natural populations, adhering to the principles of natural selection and the concept of "survival of the fittest." By emulating this phenomenon, genetic algorithms possess the capability to "evolve" solutions for real-world problems, provided they have been encoded effectively.

While GA does not assure convergence or the discovery of the global optimal solution, it does tend to furnish an "acceptably good" solution relatively swiftly, on average. Typically, GA is extensively tailored to suit specific applications, resulting in a myriad of variants. Consequently, pinning down a singular "generic" or "traditional" GA proves challenging due to this diversity. Nevertheless, a study of the foundational concepts behind early GA, along with exploration of its various adaptations, enables the identification of key operations, culminating in a conceptualization of a "traditional" GA.

The fundamental components of the "traditional" GA encompass a fitness function, a selection technique, and fixed-probability-driven crossover and mutation operators. The population comprises all chromosomes, treated as individuals, with each iteration referred to as a generation, signifying an iterative updating of the population. Chromosomes, composed of genes reflecting parameters for optimization, embody potential solutions to the optimization problem, facilitating the simultaneous evaluation of multiple solutions.

The GA's dimension corresponds to the search space dimension, equating to the number of genes housed within each chromosome. The fitness function assumes a pivotal role, enabling the GA to assess the performance of each chromosome within the population. Tailored for each specific problem, the fitness function serves as the sole bridge between the GA and the application itself, necessitating a careful and precise selection. Its design must accurately mirror the application's parameters and their optimization criteria.

The selection operator plays a critical role by electing chromosomes from the current generation to act as parents for the subsequent generation. This selection process favors the most fit individuals, and the probability of each chromosome's selection adheres to a specific scheme, dictating the genetic inheritance for the subsequent iterations.

The process described outlines the selection, crossover, and mutation stages within the Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework:

1. **Selection**:

- {{< katex>}}F_s(i){{< /katex>}} represents the probability of selection for the {{< katex>}}i^{th}{{< /katex>}} chromosome, while f(i) denotes its fitness value.
- Chromosomes are selected in pairs, ensuring diversity by re-normalizing probabilities after each selection to avoid selecting the same chromosome.
- Each pair consists of two distinct chromosomes, allowing for multiple associations of a single chromosome across different pairs.

2. **Crossover**:

- As the primary local search process, crossover drives the generation of new offspring from selected parent pairs.
- Two offspring are generated for each parent pair selected by the selection operator.
- Prior to the algorithm's execution, a predetermined probability of crossover determines whether each parent pair undergoes crossover or replication.
- Replication leads to offspring identical to their parents, while crossover involves converting parent pairs to binary notation and exchanging bits beyond a randomly chosen crossover point to form the offspring pair.
