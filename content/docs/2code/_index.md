# Workflow


Hey hey! Welcome to my coding project hub â€” a spot where you'll find the fruits of my academic hustle. These projects? They're like little milestones in my coding journey, from cracking algorithmic puzzles to diving deep into data analysis.

But hey, it's not just textbooks and lectures (though I have a soft spot for the math and logic behind it) â€” I've teamed up with some awesome friends from all corners of the globe. My playground has been a mix of deciphering data, diving into the realms of AI, tinkering with robotics, and optimizing systems using clever computational techniques.

I'm a firm believer in code's magic to bring ideas to life, and I'm stoked to give you a peek into my coding adventures. Take a tour through these projects; hope they spark as much joy in you as they did in me!

Shoot me a message if you are interested in more. ðŸ¤“âœ¨
