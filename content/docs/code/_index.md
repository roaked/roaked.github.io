# **Abstract**


Welcome to the repository showcasing interesting research projects in my journey through the field of applied system design. This comprehensive hub offers a glimpse into a range of accomplishments, encompassing the successful resolution of complex algorithmic challenges and the in-depth exploration of data analysis methodologies. 

I strongly believe in the power of code — it's what turns ideas into reality.
