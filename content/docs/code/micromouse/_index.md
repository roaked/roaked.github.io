# AI Pioneers: Theseus' Debut in Maze Navigation and Graph Traversal

[According to many sources](https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?module=objects&type=related&kv=76066), "the first system (...) is the Theseus. It was built by *Claude Shannon* in 1950 and was a remote-controlled mouse that was able to find its way out of a labyrinth and could remember its course.
