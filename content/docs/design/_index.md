# **Abstract**

This is my engineering repository that contains a few of my designs in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and 3D CAD projects.

- [Double Girder Crane Design for Industrial Applications](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/industrial-crane-design/)

- [FEM Package Development for a Case of Torsional Loading using Prandtl Equations](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/finite-element-method-development/)

- [Manual Transmission Design of a Normal Compound Gear Train](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/manual-transmission-design/)
