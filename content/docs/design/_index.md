# **Abstract**

Welcome to my design project repository — a mashup of my academic journey, fruitful collaborations and extracurricular competitions. This place contains a few of my design adventures in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and 3D CAD projects. 

From late-night brainstorming sessions to immersing myself in simulations of fluid dynamics, thermal analysis, and structural mechanics, this space encapsulates the fusion of design concepts with intricate simulations.

From conceptualization to realization...
