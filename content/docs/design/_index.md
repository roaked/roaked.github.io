# **Abstract**

This is the design project repository that contains a few of my design adventures in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and 3D CAD projects. 

From conceptualization to realization...

- [Evaluating the Global and Local Instability Modes using Finite Element Analysis](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/fea-beam-simulation/)

- [Double Girder Crane Design for Industrial Applications](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/industrial-crane-design/)

- [FEM Package Development for a Case of Torsional Loading using Prandtl Equations](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/finite-element-method-development/)

- [Manual Transmission Design of a Normal Compound Gear Train](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/manual-transmission-design/#4-you-spin-me-right-round)

- [Applications of Electron-Beam Technology for Additive Manufacturing and Joining Processes](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/electron-beam-tech/)
