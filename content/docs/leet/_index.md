# **DSA Lectures @ GitHub**

![q031](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53470682660_24754952d2_w.jpg)

I am currently holding programming lectures on data structures and algorithms encompassing different levels at my current position. I have taught the basics to undergraduate students, as well as, to doctoral colleagues of mine without prior extensive experience in programming. The [TeX presentations are available @ my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures) As [Steve Brunton said in one his videos](https://youtu.be/wDVteayWWvU?t=52), one of greatest ways to learn is by teaching it to other people. Hopefully, more to come. :)

- I can recommend the Grokkings series of books for learning diverse computing topics!

## **Exploring DSA with LeetCode**

In addition, this is a small sample of my interest for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode. 

{{< hint warning >}}
While I may not consider myself an expert, I'm passionate about problem-solving and enjoy exploring these challenges purely for the joy of it..{{< /hint >}}

## **GitHub Repo**

Explore my solutions, implementations, and additional resources in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/roaked/leetcode). The repository contains a comprehensive collection of my LeetCode problem solutions, providing a detailed look at my coding practices and problem-solving approaches. :)
