# **DSA Lectures @ GitHub**

I am currently holding programming lectures that cover data structures and algorithms at various levels in my current role. My teaching experience spans from introducing fundamental concepts to undergraduate students to guiding doctoral colleagues with limited prior programming experience through more advanced topics.


#### A highly effective method of learning is through the process of teaching others as sharing knowledge not only helps them but also deepens your own understanding of the subject --- [Prof. Steve Brunton, University of Washington](https://youtu.be/wDVteayWWvU?t=52)

The TeX presentations are available [@ my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures)

# **Exploring DSA with LeetCode**

In addition, this is a small sample of my interest for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode. 

{{< hint warning >}}
While I may not consider myself an expert, I'm passionate about problem-solving and enjoy exploring these challenges purely for the joy of it..{{< /hint >}}

## **GitHub Repo**

Explore my solutions, implementations, and additional resources in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/roaked/leetcode). The repository contains a comprehensive collection of my LeetCode problem solutions, providing a detailed look at my coding practices and problem-solving approaches. :)
