# **Workflow**

Hey hey! Welcome to my design project hangout — a mashup of my academic journey and awesome collaborations. This place is packed with my adventures in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and loads of cool 3D CAD projects.

Picture this: late-night brainstorming, diving into simulations of fluid dynamics, thermal analysis, and structural mechanics, and then making those wild ideas real. It's like a ride where design and simulation crash together in the coolest ways.

I'm totally up for collaborating on any design projects — let's create something new!
