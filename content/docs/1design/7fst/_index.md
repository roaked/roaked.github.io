## 1. Background

During Formula Student (FS) competitions, students are tasked with creating, testing, and refining a race car adhering to specific guidelines outlined by [Formula Student Germany (FSG)](https://www.formulastudent.de/) and [Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE)](https://www.fsaeonline.com/). The [Formula Student Team at Tecnico Lisboa (FST Lisboa)](https://www.fstlisboa.com/) has been actively involved in these competitions since 2001. In 2019, with a team comprising over 40 members, they embarked on dual projects for their 10th generation cars. One project involved crafting a new electric prototype, termed FST10e, while simultaneously enhancing the existing FST09e—previously in competition during the summer of 2019 — with autonomous capabilities, transforming it into FST10d. FST09e was the team's 5th electric prototype and secured a commendable 9th place overall in FSG 2019, a notably competitive event within the Formula Student season.

Each FS competition comprises three static events focusing on design, manufacturing, cost, and business plans. Concurrently, the dynamic events assess the car's performance through four different challenges:

- Acceleration: a straight line with a length of 75 m;

- Skidpad: This involves navigating an 8-shaped track to evaluate the vehicle's lateral acceleration capabilities.

- Autocross: A single lap around a handling track approximately 1 km in length, focusing on overall handling and speed.

- Endurance/Trackdrive & Efficiency: This event comprises several laps around a closed circuit. Trackdrive is designated for Driverless cars, while Endurance is for other vehicle types.

Before 2019, most FS competitions accommodated three distinct car classes: combustion, electric, and driverless. Vehicles in the driverless class were required to autonomously complete all four dynamic events. However, in response to the burgeoning investment in autonomous driving within the automotive industry, the FSG organization made a significant decision. Starting from 2021, there would no longer be a separate driverless class. Instead, all participating vehicles must perform the acceleration event in driverless mode, and from 2022 onward, driverless mode is also mandatory for the skidpad. Teams unable to accomplish these driverless events risk losing substantial points, amplifying the drive to develop this technology further.

Major automotive industry players sponsor FS competitions, providing officials and design judges. They actively shape the competition landscape, aligning it with their future engineering requirements and fostering a talent pipeline by engaging with participating students.

## 2. Coding + Design?

Lately, there's been a lot of excitement around autonomous vehicles, spurring most OEMs to invest heavily in creating their own solutions for the complexities of self-driving cars. Significant progress in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and smart transportation has led to many vehicles demonstrating semi-autonomous capabilities, inching closer to achieving full autonomy. The growing fascination with autonomous vehicles, reflected in initiatives like Formula Student competitions that encourage tech development, offers a promising chance to delve deeper into this field.
