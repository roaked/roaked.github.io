# ThermoCup Competition

## Introduction

ThermoCup is a unique competition introduced initially at the Technical University of Lisbon during the MecanIST conferences in early 2016. Its primary objective is to challenge participants to conceive, design, and construct a steam boat. The competition covers a comprehensive spectrum of engineering aspects, incorporating various stages of the project lifecycle, from the initial conceptualization and design phase to the practical implementation, prototyping, and subsequent optimization processes.


## Key-use of Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

The use of **CFD** simulations with Ansys Fluent workbench stands as a pivotal aspect of this competition. **Ansys Fluent** is a powerful software suite extensively used in engineering for simulating fluid flow, heat transfer, and other related phenomena. Its utilization within ThermoCup implies that participants are tasked with not only physically constructing a steam boat but also employing sophisticated virtual simulations to refine their designs and enhance the boat's performance characteristics.

## Problem-solving Competences

The challenges within ThermoCup likely encompass a range of engineering disciplines, including:

- Mechanical Engineering: To design the physical structure of the steam boat, accounting for structural integrity and efficiency.

- Thermal Engineering: Understanding and optimizing the heat transfer mechanisms involved in generating steam to power the boat.

- Fluid Dynamics: Analyzing the flow of steam and water within the boat's components to maximize propulsion and efficiency.

- Computational Modeling: Employing Ansys Fluent workbench for virtual simulations to predict and optimize the boat's performance before physical construction.

## Our Approach

In the context of designing a steam boat for ThermoCup, the significance of defining boundary conditions and material selection cannot be overstated. These initial steps essentially set the groundwork for the entire project, exerting a profound influence on the boat's performance and its eventual success in the competition.
