# Workflow

Hey there! Welcome to my project portfolioâ€”an exciting showcase collected from my academic journey and collaborative endeavours. Within these digital pages, you'll immerse yourself in a driven by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), coupled with a plethora of 3D CAD project designs. From conceptualization to execution, these projects were born from late-night brainstorming sessions, leveraging cutting-edge tools to simulate fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, and to bring innovative 3D concepts to life. Exploring the thrilling realm where design meets simulation!

I am always open to collaborate in any design projects!
