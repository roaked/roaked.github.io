# Workflow

Hey there! Welcome to my project portfolioâ€”an exciting showcase collected from my academic journey and collaborative endeavours. Within these digital pages, you'll immerse yourself in an environment driven by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), coupled with a plethora of 3D CAD project designs. From conceptualization to execution, these projects were born from late-night brainstorming sessions, leveraging cutting-edge tools to simulate fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, and to bring innovative 3D concepts to life -- Exploring the thrilling realm where design meets simulation!

I am always open to collaborate in any design projects!
