## Strong Formulation

{{< katex display >}}
\theta - \nabla \dot (k \nabla u) = f
{{< /katex >}}

For the torsional loading problem k = 1 and f = 2. The following equations indulges:

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} = - 2G \theta
{{< /katex >}}

This is referring to the Prandtl stress function, which defines shear stresses as:

{{< katex display >}}
\tau_{xz} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \text{ and } \tau_{yz} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}
{{< /katex >}}

The resolution of a torsion problem involves solving the Prandtl equation by imposing the boundary condition around the entire perimeter of the figure, as is known:

{{< katex display >}}
\phi = 0
{{< /katex >}}

To do this, the Prandtl function is divided by {{< katex display >}}G theta{{< /katex >}}, as this value is not known, like this:
