# **Griaß Di. Servus!**

### Ricardo. 26. Portugal / China.

With a master's degree in mechanical engineering (got some honors, too!) specialized in simulation and all those various technical aspects, coupled with exploration in modern materials science research, I've found myself super into all sorts of computer science stuff circling back to the roots of my bachelor's journey.

I'm really into pushing boundaries and adding my own twist to science. That said, my sweet spot? Mixing my expertise in FEA with AI using my software skills to shake up engineering solutions. From conceptualization to realization, I'm all about making the design process better, using fancy tech to create workflows that ramp up efficiency, sustainability, and innovation.

When I'm not diving into tech and science, I'm out there hitting the slopes for some mountain or winter sports. And let me tell you, I've got this hardcore addiction to running. It's my peaceful escape from being constantly surrounded by people —  I'm a chatterbox. I mean, really, I can talk for hours no matter what the topic is: politics, philosophy, geology — you name it!

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world. That's why when I travel, delving into local languages is my key to forming those deep, meaningful connections wherever I go.
