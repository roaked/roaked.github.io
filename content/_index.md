# **Griaß Di. Servus!**

### Ricardo. 26. Portugal ~ China

With a [master's degree in mechanical engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) (earned honors, too!) specialized in design engineering and simulation along with an immersive experience as an university assistant delving into materials science research — coupled with supervising additive manufacturing bachelor thesis — in microelectronics fabrication for automotive / tech applications, I've rekindled my passion for all sorts of computer science stuff circling back to the roots of my bachelor's journey.

I'm really into pushing boundaries and adding my own twist to science — from conceptualization to realization, I'm driven by the thought of using fancy tech to create workflows that ramp up efficiency, sustainability, and innovation. That said, my sweet spot? Merging design and simulation expertise with software curiosity to open up doors that integrate unique elements, such as incorporating deep learning or optimization techniques, to shake up engineering solutions. 

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For this, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and made slight [CSS/HTML code modifications which can be found documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/modifications/). Recalling the difficulties I faced before, I often wished for more accessible information. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I might assist others tackling similar challenges in their research — plus, it's a great way for me to understand and refine some technical knowledge I wasn't quite as proficient before!


Although work is a significant part of my life, it's not my whole world. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a perfect and peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours — really, I could talk endlessly. Perhaps you haven't noticed, but all of these activities have one common trait — they're all solitary activities. A valuable lesson I've learned over time is to cherish the peace I find in these moments, enjoying the tranquility of being alone with my thoughts, just me by myself.

Speaking about "me by myself", isn't it interesting how most people in our lives, despite intentions to stay, often become fleeting characters in our stories? It's something my mother used to tell me when I was young, but I'd constantly forget it. You could say it was one of my problems. But as the years went by, I learned the truth behind it — the transient nature of most people. That's why I've grown to value doing things independently — working on my own, relying solely on myself, has been a path to building resilience and self-reliance. It is as if the weight of complete responsibility becomes a catalyst for personal growth... It certainly contradicts with the perception others have of me as an ideal team player. While many appear to envision me as thriving within a team dynamic, I often feel quite the opposite internally. 

**It's a curious paradox, isn't it? :)**

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world. That's why when I travel, delving into local languages is my key to forming those deep, meaningful connections wherever I go. Unfortunately, my Mandarin skills are still a work in progress, but hey, we can hold a conversation in German, Portuguese, English, and Spanish.

In my childhood, my parents were true wanderers. My mom, especially. Whenever a free moment appeared, we'd pack up the car with tents and off we'd go! They were armed with those classic analog cameras, capturing moments that felt eternally frozen in time. Those days might be long gone, but the memories? Oh, they're crystal clear. I've got this closet packed with albums, each one a time capsule of our camping expeditions. 

As I grew older, I found myself inheriting their passion for preserving moments, albeit with newer tech. My phone's become my camera, preserving my adventures. It's funny how we upgrade tools but hold onto the timeless joy of freezing [moments](https://youtu.be/0NsNfUhUm4k), just like my parents did.
