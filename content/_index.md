# **My name is Ricardo**

I am a senior ML scientist working on deploying AI/ML scalable solutions from proof-of-concept to productionization. My model development tasks broadly encompass exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and experimentation to generate explainable results in manufacturing settings. Moreover, I am well versed in advanced statistics and Bayesian modeling which enable [uncertainty quantification and overconfidence mitigation](https://ricardochin.com/#uncertainty-quantification-in-bayesian-machine-learning) leading to stronger and more robust data-driven business insights. Alongside, I lead research projects on reinforcement learning, transfer learning, physics-informed ML and metaheuristic optimization in the field of robotics.

I was previously involved with the research team of the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and also with the research group of [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). In addition, I supervised a bachelor thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) with a focus on additive manufacturing within industry applications.

My interests also lay in projects closely aligned with academia or research groups as I believe there is still so much to discover in our fast-paced world of artificial intelligence. On the side and during off hours, I also spend time learning about new technologies and [teaching data structures and algorithms for data science at various levels](https://ricardochin.com/docs/lectures/), TeX presentations available @ [my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures)

## **Run with passion, live with purpose**

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I have grown to appreciate the nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding. However, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like economy, philosophy, or even the field of geosciences for hours on end, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility.

Like many others, traveling holds significant meaning in my life, particularly exploring different countries.  It's not just about visiting new places or sightseeing; it's more about fully immersing myself in diverse cultures. With family members spread across the globe, I've experienced firsthand the power of languages in bridging people together. Mandarin is predominantly spoken among my relatives, and in spite of not being particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
