# **Hi. I am Ricardo. I like to help others to code. :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specialized in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating machine learning frameworks. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/), emphasizing on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication. Drawing from a foundation in FEA/CFD evidenced in my [design repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/), I've invested substantial time in selecting boundary conditions and refining ideal mesh parameters. Now, I'm drawn to integrating software tools to address the growing complexity of design challenges and the need for scalability. 

Simultaneously, I have always had profound curiosity in modern computing domains given my roots in Computer Science, which laid particular focus upon [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://ricardochin.com/docs/leet/) and Graph Theory. Nevertheless, at the center of my current goals lies the integration of optimization methods and AI fields (such as deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision) into engineering solutions for system design. A perfect example at my current work studies the possibility of LSTM model integration to assess machine condition based on long-horizon forecasts in a microelectronics FAB, drawing from my experience at the Materials Science research group, leveraging clustering, SVM and other AI tools for material failure analysis. In addition, I am always happy to hold lectures and teach fellow colleagues with their coding endeavours, regardless of their level. :)

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For deploying a webpage, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and [I have already committed slight code modifications which are documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/). Moreover, while collaborating with a few friends worldwide, I'm deeply engaged in a wide variety of [coding projects](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/), in specific one that explores the integration of evolutionary computation to fine-tune reinforcement deep-Q networks in modern applications that encompass autonomous driving, robotics and [game playing (Snake)](https://github.com/roaked/snake-q-learning-genetic-algorithm).

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end — really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
