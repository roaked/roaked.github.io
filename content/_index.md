# **Servus.**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specialized in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role was immersed in the integration of machine learning frameworks aimed to optimize computational simulations. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/), emphasizing on streamlining additive manufacturing processes for microelectronics fabrication.

Drawing from a foundation in FEA/CFD evidenced in my [design repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/), I've invested substantial time in selecting boundary conditions and refining ideal mesh parameters for precise simulation outcomes. Now, I'm drawn to integrating software tools to address the growing complexity of design challenges and the need for scalability. This has sparked a profound curiosity in modern computing domains, particularly in [Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](https://ricardochin.com/docs/leet/), reigniting my enthusiasm for computer science -- a return to the roots of my bachelor's journey.

At the center of my current goals lies the integration of optimization methods and AI fields (such as deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision) into engineering solutions for system design. As disclosed in my [coding repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/), I prioritize the use of efficient, robust code to effectively tackle these challenges.

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For deploying a webpage, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and, although responsiveness of images and extensive LaTeX/KaTeX equations in the CSS script haven't yet increased, [I have already committed slight code modifications which are documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/). Moreover, while collaborating with a few friends worldwide, I'm deeply engaged in a project that explores the integration of evolutionary computation to fine-tune reinforcement deep-Q networks in modern applications that encompass autonomous driving, robotics and [game playing (Snake)](https://github.com/roaked/snake-q-learning-genetic-algorithm). In addition, and despite not being a competitive programmer myself, I still enjoy a challenging DSA puzzle as showcased in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/roaked/leetcode).

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction â€” a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end â€” really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
