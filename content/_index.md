## **My Database**

As a lead ML researcher, I focus on the high-level design of scalable software products, transitioning from PoC experimentation into productionization. My research is at the intersection of interpretable generative AI and efficient model deployment, where I leverage retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to enhance adaptive decision-making in cross-functional settings and generate data-driven business insights. In addition, I have led research projects that enclose state-of-the-art implementations in reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, transfer and meta learning, real-time object detection and metaheuristic optimization.

I was previously associated with the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and a researcher for the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). 

I am also interested in projects closely aligned with academia or research groups as I believe there is still so much to discover in our fast-paced world of artificial intelligence. On the side and during off hours, I also spend time learning about new technologies and [teaching data structures and algorithms for data science at various levels](https://ricardochin.com/docs/lectures/), TeX presentations available @ [my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures)

## **Run with passion, live with purpose**

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I have grown to appreciate the nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding. However, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like economy, philosophy, or even the field of geosciences for hours on end, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility.

Like many others, traveling holds significant meaning in my life, particularly exploring different countries.  It's not just about visiting new places or sightseeing; it's more about fully immersing myself in diverse cultures. With family members spread across the globe, I've experienced firsthand the power of languages in bridging people together. Mandarin is predominantly spoken among my relatives, and in spite of not being particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
