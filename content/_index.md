After earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394), specializing in design engineering and simulation, I delved into materials science research as a university assistant at the Technical University of Graz. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the University of Leoben, concentrating on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication, a field closely tied to my current work. Moreover, I've reignited my passion for various computer science topics, circling back to the roots of my bachelor's journey. I'm deeply immersed in diverse modern computing domains, with a particular focus on data structures and algorithms, recognizing their leading role in my creative problem-solving strategies in system design.

### I find joy in optimizing code and algorithms to achieve the highest efficiency and performance.

Drawing from my background in design using FEA/CFD, countless hours were spent defining precise boundary conditions and selecting optimal mesh parameters for achieving accurate simulation results. Hence, to address the evolving complexity of these design challenges and the increasing necessity for scalability, my interest falls under software tools integration, focusing on AI domains such as Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), conventionally in Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration seeks to disrupt conventional engineering solutions and solve by introducing unique elements from AI and optimization techniques, reshaping the design process from conceptualization to realization.

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For this, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and made slight [CSS/HTML code modifications which can be found documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/). Current projects include increasing the responsiveness of images and extensive LaTeX/KaTeX equations in my FE CSS code. As a side project, I have been exploring the usage of genetic-based reinforcement deep-Q networks for fine-tuning of hyperparameters in a [Snake game environment](https://github.com/roaked/snake-q-learning-genetic-algorithm).

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction â€” a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end â€” really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
