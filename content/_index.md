Besides loving mountain or winter sports and having a serious addiction to running, I'm always eager to learn. With a family scattered across the globe, languages have become my gateway to connection. Mandarin, in particular, holds a special place as it's the language spoken by most of my family. By growing up in such environment, I came to realize that truly connecting with someone necessitates interaction in their native language. It hit me that speaking the local language is the most genuine way to establish a deep and meaningful connection with others, regardless of where they are in the world."
