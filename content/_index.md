### Ricardo. 26. Portugal ~ China

Having obtained a [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) specialized in design engineering and simulation, I delved into materials science research as an university assistant. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication, particularly in automotive and tech applications, closely aligned with my current work. As an added bonus, I've rekindled my enthusiasm for all sorts of computer science topics gradually circling back to the roots of my bachelor's journey.

I'm really into pushing boundaries and adding my own twist to science — from conceptualization to realization, I'm driven by the thought of using fancy tech to create workflows that ramp up efficiency, sustainability, and innovation. That said, I'm interested in merging design and simulation expertise with software curiosity to open up doors that integrate unique elements, such as incorporating deep learning or optimization techniques, to shake up engineering solutions. 

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For this, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and made slight [CSS/HTML code modifications which can be found documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/). Recalling the difficulties I faced before, I often wished for more accessible information. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I might assist others tackling similar challenges in their research — plus, it's a great way for me to understand and refine some technical knowledge I wasn't quite as proficient before!

Although work is a significant part of my life, it's not my whole world. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours — really, I could talk endlessly. However, since most of these activities are kind of solitary, a valuable lesson I've learned over time is to cherish the peace I find in these moments, enjoying the tranquility that comes with them.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
