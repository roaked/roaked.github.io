## **Behind the Scenes**

As a lead MLE, I focus on the system design of scalable software solutions, transitioning from PoC experimentation into productionization. I have worked in projects that enclose state-of-the-art implementations in self-supervised learning, reinforcement and imitation learning, transfer and meta learning, uncertainty quantification, metaheuristics and a few engineering applications delving into computer vision.

I was previously associated with the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and a researcher for the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home).

## **Run with Passion, Live with Purpose**

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I have grown to appreciate the nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. However, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature.
