# **My name is Ricardo :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specializing in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating supervised classifier algorithms and other auxiliary AI frameworks for material failure analysis. From research to a high-volume manufacturing setting, I explored the potential of machine learning in forecasting machine conditions using long short-term memory models. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) that emphasized on additive manufacturing.

My foundational roots in computer science instanced in me a deep curiosity in modern theoretical computing, particularly in the domain of stochastic optimization. My interests are motivated by intelligent decision-making, safe learning and probabilistic reasoning through Bayesian beliefs and Bayesian decision theory to address the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in real-world engineering challenges enclosing advanced manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles or drone technology. Although machine learning has experienced significant growth recently, increasing interpretability of intricate dynamic systems continues to pose a challenging and critical task particularly in scenarios where understanding the stochasticity of predictions parallels the importance of making accurate predictions. Integrating human expertise in physics-informed learning and robust evolutionary computing in deep network topologies are two different ways that aim to tackle the associated unpredictibility, but I believe there is so much more. Hence, I spend a lot of time learning about new technologies. The key takeaway is that I understand the most by creating what I want to know and have to find answers to all the details that I would possibly neglect. This webpage is a reflection of this personal research, [showcased at my system repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/). In addition, I also hold [programming lectures](https://ricardochin.com/docs/lectures/) that cover data structures and algorithms at various levels, TeX presentations available @ [my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures).

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I love immersing myself in nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding, embracing the thrill of the season. However, amidst these exhilarating activities, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction.  --- it offers me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like politics, philosophy, or the captivating field of geology for hours on end, addressing the impacts of climate change on skiing and mountain ecosystems, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility, cherishing the serene moments these activities afford me.

Similarly to most people, traveling, especially to various countries, holds great importance in my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. With family members scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages serve as powerful bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a dear place in my heart. Despite not particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
