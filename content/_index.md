# **My name is Ricardo**

I am a senior data scientist working on deploying end-to-end AI/ML scalable solutions to production through HPC clusters. My tasks also encompass exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to generate explainable results in manufacturing settings. Alongside, I do research on reinforcement learning, physics informed ML and metaheuristic optimization for cyber-physical systems applications such as those in robotics. Moreover, I am also well versed in advanced statistics and Bayesian modeling which enable uncertainty quantification and mitigated model overconfidence leading to stronger data-driven strategy insights.

I was previously involved with the research team of the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and also with the research group of [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home). In addition, I supervised a bachelor thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) with a focus on additive manufacturing within industry applications.

## **Uncertainty quantification in Bayesian machine learning**

AI models possess impressive abilities, yet they frequently exhibit overconfidence. They behave poorly at estimating uncertainty in their predictions and often are unable to say "I donâ€™t know" in response to an unfamiliar situation. Hence, I am interested in probabilistic machine learning to tackle decision-making challenges within practical engineer applications, specifically those in advanced manufacturing and cyberphysical systems where repercussions of incorrect predictions can be catastrophic, making the need for addressing uncertainty and overconfidence paramount.

*"Intelligent systems operate autonomously in, and adapt to, complex changing environments, but our understanding of this phenomena is still limited"* --- [Institute of Max Planck Research](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)

There are many diverse ways of increasing model explainability. Naturally, all rely on an intrinsic mathematical framework and prior knowledge to accelerate this complex process, but given the fast-paced world of machine learning, I believe there is so much more. Hence, I spend a lot of time learning about new technologies. In addition, I also hold [programming lectures](https://ricardochin.com/docs/lectures/) that cover data structures and algorithms at various levels, TeX presentations available @ [my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures)

## **Run with passion, live with purpose**

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I love immersing myself in nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding, embracing the thrill of the season. However, amidst these exhilarating activities, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction  --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like politics, philosophy, or the captivating field of geology for hours on end, addressing the impacts of climate change on skiing and mountain ecosystems, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility, cherishing the serene moments these activities afford me.

Like many others, traveling holds significant meaning in my life, particularly exploring different countries.  It's not just about visiting new places or sightseeing; it's more about fully immersing myself in diverse cultures. With family members spread across the globe, I've experienced firsthand the power of languages in bridging people together. Mandarin is predominantly spoken among my relatives, and in spite of not being particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
