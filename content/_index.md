After earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394), specializing in design engineering and simulation, I delved into materials science research as a university assistant at the Technical University of Graz. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the University of Leoben, concentrating on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication, a field closely tied to my current work. Moreover, I've reignited my passion for various computer science topics, circling back to the roots of my bachelor's journey. I'm deeply immersed in diverse modern computing domains, with a particular interest on data structures and algorithms, recognizing their leading role in my creative problem-solving strategies for system design.

Drawing from a foundation in design through FEA/CFD, I've dedicated significant time to refining boundary conditions and selecting ideal mesh parameters for precise simulation outcomes. Now, I'm additionally drawn to integrating software tools to tackle the growing complexity of design challenges and the need for scalability. Specifically, my focus lies in merging AI domains like Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) into engineering solutions. This integration aims to revolutionize conventional engineering approaches by incorporating AI and optimization techniques, transforming the design process from conception to fruition.

It's become a hobby of mine to sort through my [recent and past projects](https://github.com/roaked?tab=repositories) with the intention of showcasing them online. For this, I've utilized the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and, although responsiveness of images and extensive LaTeX/KaTeX equations in the CSS code have not increased as of yet, [I have already committed slight code modifications which can be found documented here](https://ricardochin.com/docs/mod/). Moreover, collaborating with a few friends spread across Europe, I'm deeply engaged in a personal project exploring the integration of evolutionary computation to fine-tune reinforcement deep-Q networks for modern applications that encompass autonomous driving, robotics and [game playing (Snake)](https://github.com/roaked/snake-q-learning-genetic-algorithm).

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction â€” a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end â€” really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
