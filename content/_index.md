# **My name is Ricardo :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specializing at the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating supervised classifier algorithms and other auxiliary AI frameworks for material failure analysis. From research to a high-volume manufacturing setting, I explored the potential of machine learning in forecasting machine conditions using long short-term memory models. In addition, I supervised a bachelor thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) highlighting the benefits of additive manufacturing in integrated circuit packaging substrate production for high-performance computing.

My foundational roots in computer science drove my exploration into modern computing, particularly focusing on intelligent systems. AI models possess impressive abilities, yet they frequently exhibit overconfidence. They behave poorly at estimating uncertainty in their predictions and often are unable to say "I donâ€™t know" in response to an unfamiliar situation. My interests concern probabilistic machine learning to tackle decision-making challenges within practical engineer applications, specifically those in advanced manufacturing and autonomous cyberphysical systems where repercussions of incorrect predictions can be catastrophic, making the need for addressing uncertainty and overconfidence paramount. Another area of interest of mine revolves around increasing interpretability of intricate dynamical systems, which continue to pose a challenging task, particularly in scenarios where understanding the inherent stochasticity of predictions parallels the importance of making accurate predictions.

*"Intelligent systems operate autonomously in, and adapt to, complex changing environments, but our understanding of this phenomena is still limited"* --- [Institute of Max Planck Research for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)

Exploring physics-informed deep networks or diving into model-based learning approaches are distinct ways of increasing model explainability by relying on an intrinsic mathematical framework and prior knowledge, but given the fast-paced world of machine learning, I believe there is so much more. Hence, I spend a lot of time learning about new technologies. The key takeaway is that I understand the most by creating what I want to know and have to find answers to all the details that I would possibly neglect. This webpage is a reflection of this personal research, [showcased at my system repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/). In addition, I also hold [programming lectures](https://ricardochin.com/docs/lectures/) that cover data structures and algorithms at various levels, TeX presentations available @ [my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/programming-lectures)

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I love immersing myself in nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding, embracing the thrill of the season. However, amidst these exhilarating activities, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction  --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like politics, philosophy, or the captivating field of geology for hours on end, addressing the impacts of climate change on skiing and mountain ecosystems, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility, cherishing the serene moments these activities afford me.

Like many others, traveling holds significant meaning in my life, particularly exploring different countries.  It's not just about visiting new places or sightseeing; it's more about fully immersing myself in diverse cultures. With family members spread across the globe, I've experienced firsthand the power of languages in bridging people together. Mandarin is predominantly spoken among my relatives, and in spite of not being particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
