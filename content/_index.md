# **Hi — I am Ricardo. :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) specializing in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating clustering, SVM and auxiliary AI frameworks for material failure analysis. This heightened my knowledge in LSTM model development to forecast machine conditions at a high-volume manufacturing setting. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) that emphasized on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication. 

My roots in Computer Science focused on [Data Structures, Algorithms](https://ricardochin.com/docs/leet/) and Graph Theory, sparked my deep curiosity in modern computing. One of my primary interest lies on applying computational optimization with branches of deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to engineer innovative solutions. Therefore, I spend a lot of time learning about new technologies. The key takeaway is that I understand the most by creating what I want to know. By researching for [a few system design projects](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/), I have to find answers to all the details that I would otherwise neglect.

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end — really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.


Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
