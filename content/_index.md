# **Hello Guest!**

## About me!

With honors in mechanical engineering and a background in materials science research, I've developed a deep fascination for diverse fields within computer science. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of what's achievable. Leveraging software skills to seamlessly merge FEA with AI, I aim to transform engineering solutions. From conceptualization to realization, I'm dedicated to reshaping the design process employing advanced technology to create experiences that embody efficiency, sustainability, and innovation advancements."

## Learning

Besides loving mountain or winter sports and having a serious addiction to running, I'm always eager to learn. With a family scattered across the globe, languages have become my gateway to connection. Mandarin, in particular, holds a special place as it's the language spoken by most of my family. By growing up in such environment, I came to realize that truly connecting with someone necessitates interaction in their native language. It hit me that speaking the local language is the most genuine way to establish a deep and meaningful connection with others, regardless of where they are in the world."
