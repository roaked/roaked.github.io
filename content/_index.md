# **Hi — I am Ricardo. :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specialized in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating machine learning frameworks for material failure analysis. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/), emphasizing on additive manufacturing for microelectronics fabrication. Drawing from a foundation in FEA/CFD evidenced in my [design repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/design/), I've invested substantial time in selecting boundary conditions and refining ideal mesh parameters. Now, I'm drawn to integrating software tools to address the growing complexity of design challenges and the need for scalability. 


My roots in Computer Science focused on [Data Structures, Algorithms](https://ricardochin.com/docs/leet/), and Graph Theory, sparking my deep curiosity in modern computing. Currently, my primary interest lies on merging optimization methods with branches in the sense of deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to engineer innovative solutions for [system design challenges, as per my coding repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/). Moreover, my experience in Materials Science research, utilizing clustering, SVM, and AI tools, has already pushed me into developing LSTM models to forecast machine conditions in a high-volume manufacturing setting.

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end — really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.

Naturally, traveling, particularly to different continents, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
