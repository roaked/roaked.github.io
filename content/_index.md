# **Hi — I am Ricardo. :)**

Upon earning my [master's degree in mechanical engineering with honors](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/memec/dissertacao/1128253548922394) from the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), specializing in systems engineering, I delved into [the Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) of the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) as a university assistant. My role revolved around the enhancement of design models using computational simulations by integrating supervised classifier algorithms and other auxiliary AI frameworks for material failure analysis. From research to a high-volume manufacturing setting, I explored the potential of machine learning in forecasting machine conditions using long short-term memory models. In addition, I supervised bachelors thesis at the [University of Leoben](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/) that emphasized on additive manufacturing.

My foundational roots in computer science sparked a deep curiosity in modern computing. My interests are motivated by intelligent decision-making and hyperparameter tuning through Bayesian beliefs or evolutionary strategies in deep network topologies, addressing the dillema of exploration and exploitation mechanisms. Although machine learning has experienced significant growth recently, increasing interpretability of intricate dynamic systems continues to pose a challenging and critical task particularly in scenarios where understanding the stochasticity of predictions parallels the importance of making accurate predictions. In recent times, integration of unsupervised learning methods such as clustering or autoencoders have enabled us to collect essential features and tackle the associated unpredictibility, but I believe there is so much more. Hence, I spend a lot of time learning about new technologies. The key takeaway is that I understand the most by creating what I want to know and have to find answers to all the details that I would possibly neglect. This webpage is a reflection of this personal research, [showcased at my coding repository](https://ricardochin.com/docs/code/). Have a look and besides, I also hold programming lectures encompassing different levels from undergrad to PhD students, [LaTeX presentations available @ my Github page!](https://github.com/roaked/)

Although work is a significant part of my life, it doesn't define everything I am. I love hitting the slopes for some mountain sports and taking time for winter activities. Running, though, that's my serious addiction — a peaceful getaway from the constant social interaction, despite my talkative nature. I mean, I can dive into conversations spanning politics, philosophy, or the fascinating realms of geology for hours on end — really, I truly have an endless conversation capacity. Nevertheless, as most of these activities tend to be solitary, I've learned a valuable lesson over time: to appreciate the tranquility and peace these moments offer, cherishing the calm they bring into my life.


Naturally, traveling, particularly to different countries, is also a big part of my life. Exploring new places allows me to not just visit but truly immerse myself in diverse cultures. See, with family scattered across the globe, I've learned firsthand how languages are like bridges connecting people. Mandarin, being the language spoken by most of my family, holds a special place in my heart. It's taught me something profound: speaking someone's native language is the ultimate way to create genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
