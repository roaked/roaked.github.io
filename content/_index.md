## **Behind the Scenes**

As a lead ML researcher, I focus on the high-level design of scalable software solutions, transitioning from PoC experimentation into productionization. I have worked in research projects that enclose state-of-the-art implementations in self-supervised learning, reinforcement and imitation learning, transfer and meta learning, uncertainty quantification, metaheuristics and a few engineering applications delving into computer vision.

I was previously associated with the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and a researcher for the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home).

## **Run with Passion, Live with Purpose**

While work plays a significant role in my life, it doesn't encapsulate my entire self. I have grown to appreciate the nature through long hikes and engaging in mountain sports during the summer months. As winter sets in, I always take my time hitting the slopes, whether it be resort skiing or free riding. However, running holds a special place in my heart as my true addiction --- offering me a peaceful escape from constant social interaction, despite my inherently talkative nature. I can dive into conversations about diverse topics like economy, philosophy, or even the field of geosciences for hours on end, but I've also come to appreciate the value of solitude and tranquility.

Like many others, traveling holds significant meaning in my life, particularly exploring different countries.  It's not just about visiting new places or sightseeing; it's more about fully immersing myself in diverse cultures. With family members spread across the globe, I've experienced firsthand the power of languages in bridging people together. Mandarin is predominantly spoken among my relatives, and in spite of not being particularly skilled in it, it has taught me a valuable lesson: speaking someone's native tongue is the most authentic way to establish genuine connections, no matter where you are in the world.
