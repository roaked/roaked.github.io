## **Behind the Scenes**

As a Lead Data Scientist, I design and architect scalable AI systems, transforming business concepts into production-ready solutions. My work lies at the intersection between applied data science and research, managing the entire ML lifecycle from exploratory data analysis to deployed model evaluation. I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification using probabilistic and Bayesian methods to enhance data-driven decisions within engineering domains.

I was previously associated with the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and contributed to research of the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home).
