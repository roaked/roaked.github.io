## **Behind the Scenes**

Iâ€™m a Lead Machine Learning Engineer specializing in designing and deploying scalable AI systems that transform business ideas into production-ready solutions. My work lies at the intersection of applied ML and research, with a focus on responsible self-supervised learning, multimodal architectures, reinforcement learning, anomaly and trend detection, and metaheuristic optimization.

I was previously associated with the [Center of Intelligent Systems](https://csi.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at the [Technical University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and collaborated with the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/imat/home) at the [Technical University of Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home).

## **Run with Passion, Live with Purpose**

Growing up in Lisbon, I developed a love for the seaside, while my time in the Alps introduced me to the beauty of the mountains. I enjoy long-distance trail running, road racing, mountaineering, ski touring and trad climbing as my main hobbies.
