In this method, each potential solution is likened to a particle, and these particles come together to form a dynamic swarm. Each particle possesses two key characteristics: its position and its velocity. Utilizing this velocity, each particle embarks on a journey to a new position within the search space.</description></item><item><title>Discrete Controller</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/discrete-controller-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/code/uav/discrete-controller-design/</guid><description>Phase 3.
