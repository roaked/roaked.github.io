Actuation System: This handles the rotors&amp;rsquo; model, the forces they generate ( \(F_p\) ), and the moments they create ( \(M_p\) ).</description></item><item><title>Genetic Algorithm</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/5od/_index2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/5od/_index2/</guid><description>Evolutionary Computing: Where Algorithms Find Their Inner Darwin # Source Source 1 Theoretical Remarks # Genetic Algorithm (GA) stands as an adaptive method employed for resolving search and optimization dilemmas. Operating across numerous generations, it simulates the evolutionary process observed in natural populations, adhering to the principles of natural selection and the concept of &amp;ldquo;survival of the fittest.&amp;rdquo; By emulating this phenomenon, genetic algorithms possess the capability to &amp;ldquo;evolve&amp;rdquo; solutions for real-world problems, provided they have been encoded effectively.</description></item><item><title>Drone Controller Design Pt. 1</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index3/</guid><description>Phase 2.

If you wish to skip the theoretical and implementation details, please click here to jump to the summarized findings Ch. 9 - Piloting in a Loop. I have cool images! ✌️ 1 Continuing from Section 1&amp;hellip; # Previously, I had addressed problem formulation and initial approaches. The primary tasks included studying the system and subsystems, creating a state-space model for the dynamical system, analyzing aspects like linearity, stability, controllability, and observability, developing Simulink models, proposing classical state feedback control, and validating the simulator for the developed models.</description></item><item><title>Particle Swarm Optimization</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/5od/_index3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/5od/_index3/</guid><description> Introduction #</description></item><item><title>Drone Controller Design Pt. 2</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ricardo.chin@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Ricardo Chin)</author><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/2code/1drone/_index4/</guid><description>Phase 3.
